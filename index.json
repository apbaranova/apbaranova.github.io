Otherwise, Markdown thinks that they’re intended to be an HTML tag.\nFor example, encode as \u0026lt;script name\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;script name\u0026gt;.\nAngle brackets don’t have to be escaped in text formatted as inline code or in code blocks. Apostrophes and quotation marks\nIf you copy from Word into a Markdown editor, the text might contain “smart” (curly) apostrophes or quotation marks. These need to be encoded or changed to basic apostrophes or quotation marks. Otherwise, you end up with things like this when the file is published: Itâ€™s\nHere are the encodings for the “smart” versions of these punctuation marks:\nLeft (opening) quotation mark: \u0026amp;#8220; Right (closing) quotation mark: \u0026amp;#8221; Right (closing) single quotation mark or apostrophe: \u0026amp;#8217; Left (opening) single quotation mark (rarely used): \u0026amp;#8216;  Tip\nTo avoid “smart” characters in your Markdown files, rely on the Docs Authoring Pack’s smart quote replacement feature. For more information, see smart quote replacement. Blockquotes\nBlockquotes are created using the \u0026gt; character: Markdown\n This is a blockquote. It is usually rendered indented and with a different background color.\n The preceding example renders as follows:\nThis is a blockquote. It is usually rendered indented and with a different background color.  Bold and italic text\nTo format text as bold, enclose it in two asterisks: Markdown\nThis text is bold.\nTo format text as italic, enclose it in a single asterisk: Markdown\nThis text is italic.\nTo format text as both bold and italic, enclose it in three asterisks: Markdown\nThis text is both bold and italic.\nFor guidance on when to use bold and italic text, see text formatting guidelines. Code snippets\nDocs Markdown supports the placement of code snippets both inline in a sentence and as a separate “fenced” block between sentences. For more information, see How to add code to docs. Columns\nThe columns Markdown extension gives Docs authors the ability to add column-based content layouts that are more flexible and powerful than basic Markdown tables, which are only suited for true tabular data. You can add up to four columns, and use the optional span attribute to merge two or more columns.\nWhile the columns extension still works, we no longer recommend it for creating custom layouts. We’ve found that many custom column layouts have accessibility issues or otherwise violate Docs style guidelines. Don’t create custom layouts. Use standard Docs features.\nThe syntax for columns is as follows: Markdown\n:::row::: :::column span=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;::: Content… :::column-end::: :::column span=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;::: More content… :::column-end::: :::row-end:::\nColumns should only contain basic Markdown, including images. Headings, tables, tabs, and other complex structures shouldn’t be included. A row can’t have any content outside of column.\nFor example, the following Markdown creates one column that spans two column widths, and one standard (no span) column: Markdown\n:::row::: :::column span=“2”::: This is a 2-span column with lots of text.\n Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec vestibulum mollis nunc ornare commodo. Nullam ac metus imperdiet, rutrum justo vel, vulputate leo. Donec rutrum non eros eget consectetur.  :::column-end::: :::column span=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;::: This is a single-span column with an image in it.\n ![Doc.U.Ment](media/markdown-reference/document.png)  :::column-end::: :::row-end:::\nThis renders as follows:\nThis is a 2-span column with lots of text.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec vestibulum mollis nunc ornare commodo. Nullam ac metus imperdiet, rutrum justo vel, vulputate leo. Donec rutrum non eros eget consectetur.\nComments\nDocs supports HTML comments if you must comment out sections of your article:\nWarning\nDo not put private or sensitive information in HTML comments. Docs carries HTML comments through to the published HTML that goes public. While HTML comments are invisible to the reader’s eye, they are exposed in the HTML underneath. Headings\nDocs supports six levels of Markdown headings: Markdown\nThis is a first level heading (H1) This is a second level heading (H2) …\nThis is a sixth level heading (H6) There must be a space between the last # and heading text. Each Markdown file must have one and only one H1 heading. The H1 heading must be the first content in the file after the YML metadata block. H2 headings automatically appear in the right-hand navigating menu of the published file. Lower-level headings don\u0026#39;t appear, so use H2s strategically to help readers navigate your content. HTML headings, such as \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;, aren\u0026#39;t recommended, and in some cases will cause build warnings. You can link to individual headings in a file via bookmark links.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\nLocal Version Control Systems Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.\nTo deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.\n   { #fig:001 width=70% }\nOne of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.\nCentralized Version Control Systems The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.\n   { #fig:002 width=70% }\nThis setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.\nHowever, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines. Local VCSs suffer from this same problem — whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed Version Control Systems This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.\n   { #fig:002 width=70% }\nFurthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.\n","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"94ea21a04d022ffd5a830d7b0567d780","permalink":"https://example.com/post/post2/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post2/","section":"post","summary":"This chapter will be about getting started with Git.
